# Tic Tac Toe Game

- Tic Tac Toe, also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os, is a classic pencil-and-paper game that has been played for centuries. The origins of the game are uncertain, but it is thought to have originated in ancient Egypt or Rome. The game was popularized in Europe in the 19th century, and it has since become a popular game all over the world.

- The game is typically played on a 3x3 grid, although larger grids can be used for more challenging games. The two players take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on the grid, with the goal of getting three symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The game ends in a draw if all the squares are filled without either player getting three in a row.

- Tic Tac Toe is a simple game that has become a classic because of its simplicity and ease of play. It has been implemented in many different ways, including as a pencil-and-paper game, a board game, and a computer game. The game has also been used as a teaching tool for mathematics, logic, and programming.

- This repository contains a simple implementation of the game developed using JavaScript. The game allows two players to play the classic game of Tic Tac Toe on a 3x3 grid.
